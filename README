Why make a game where you embody a character whose defining characteristic is weakness (actually weakness, not like a Superman-Kryptonite kind of weakness).

Are all video games meant to be fun? Are all *games* meant to be fun? What else can they do? Are there other forms of expression (visual art, literature, cinema, music) that we consider strictly for entertainment/fun?
